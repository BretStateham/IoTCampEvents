## Slides ##

You can grab them from the [Slide Decks](/Slide Decks) folder in this same repo (we still need to get them uploaded).

## USB Sticks ##

There are some USB Sticks that have the large downloads you may need on them.  

**IF YOU TAKE ONE, PLEASE *COPY* THE CONTENTS TO YOUR COMPUTER THEN PASS IT ON**

**PLEASE RETURN THE USB DRIVES WHEN YOU ARE DONE**

## Bret's Event Hub and Web Site Info ##

If you are having problems with your event hub or web site, you are welcome to publish to mine.  You should change the display name in your Arduino (the `Disp[]` variable) or Gadgeteer (the `SensorName` variable) code though so that you can easily tell which sensor on the site is yours.
